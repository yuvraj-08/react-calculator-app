## Features

- **User-Friendly Interface**: A simple and intuitive user interface that allows users to perform arithmetic calculations effortlessly.

- **Component Modularity**: The app is organized into separate components ‚Äì `App.js`, `DigitButton.js`, and `OperationButton.js` ‚Äì promoting code reusability and maintainability.

- **State Management with `useReducer`**: Centralized state management using the `useReducer` hook ensures consistent and predictable state updates for smooth user interactions.

- **Arithmetic Operations**: Users can choose from addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations to perform calculations.

- **Expression Evaluation**: The `evaluate` function calculates the result of expressions based on the selected operation and operands.

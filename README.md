Welcome to the React Calculator App! This project demonstrates the creation of a basic calculator using React. It showcases essential concepts such as component interaction, state management with `useReducer`, and handling arithmetic operations. Whether you're a React beginner or seeking to reinforce your skills, this project is a great learning opportunity.

## Features

- **User-Friendly Interface**: A simple and intuitive user interface that allows users to perform arithmetic calculations effortlessly.

- **Component Modularity**: The app is organized into separate components – `App.js`, `DigitButton.js`, and `OperationButton.js` – promoting code reusability and maintainability.

- **State Management with `useReducer`**: Centralized state management using the `useReducer` hook ensures consistent and predictable state updates for smooth user interactions.

- **Arithmetic Operations**: Users can choose from addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations to perform calculations.

- **Expression Evaluation**: The `evaluate` function calculates the result of expressions based on the selected operation and operands.
